..Client Testimonials
$END $COL medium-6
This client had severe shoulder and upper back tightness for years. This was after one hour of FST.
He felt amazing when we were finished after 2 hours (doing both sides of his upper body).

Check out this girlâ€™s knees! That is right. If you look at the knee to left and then the one on her right there is a huge difference. You can see her left knee is touching the floor while her right knee is not. This is after an hour of FST treatment on her left knee.
We loosened up her right side after the picture of course so she would walk straight.
It was a pleasure to work with her and to see her results after her treatment.

This client whose hands are a great distance apart had a lot of tightness in her upper arm, chest and shoulder region. She had a lot of fear in being stretched at all because she had two previous injuries resulting in herniated discs.
Once she decided to go through with her treatment she knew she may the right decision.
She loved being open and loose in her upper and lower body. She was very glad she chose FST.
